== Description ==

Ankur is a block theme with support for color variations. It's named after a Sanskrit word which means "flower," imagery often used to depict a new beginning. At the same time, an anchor (because I love wordplay) symbolizes stability and confidence. With Ankur as the fully customizable starting point, whether as a brand new site or revamping an existing one, you can tell your story with clean typography and bold colors.

See CHANGELOG.md for changes.

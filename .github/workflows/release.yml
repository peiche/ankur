# GitHub Action: whenever creating a new release of the source code,
# also create a release of the installable plugin.
# Steps to execute:
# - Checkout the source code
# - Run "npm install" to download all npm dependencies under node_modules/
# - Build project using internal build process
# - Create a .zip file, excluding hidden and build-process files
# - Upload the .zip file as an artifact to the action (this results in a double-zipped file)
# - Upload the .zip file as a release, for download
